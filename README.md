# DeepGlove-FFT-Attention-U-Net-for-Medical-Image-Segmentation
A hybrid U-Net architecture that integrates frequency-domain features (via FFT) with attention mechanisms to improve medical image segmentation

This project implements a **U-Net architecture enhanced with FFT-based frequency features and attention mechanisms** to improve medical image segmentation accuracy.  
It demonstrates how combining **spatial and frequency-domain features** can lead to more precise segmentation results.
